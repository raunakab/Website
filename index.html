          Ontraccr is a startup based in Vancouver, British Columbia which provides an easy-to-use time-management application for construction companies.<br>
          The construction industry is a space in which the power and ease of technology is not quite present.<br>
          Many companies in this field stick to outdated methodologies for managing projects, and these outdated behaviours have significant negative impacts on their efficiencies.<br>
          This is where Ontraccr comes in; it's a web-application + mobile-application architecture in which managers can more easily communicate with their on-premise workers, assign tasks, and manage productivity.

        <p>
          UBC Bionics is a pure undergraduate, student-led engineering design team producing a robotic, prosthetic arm for patients with amputations or disabilities.<br>
          We are leading research and development into producing a low-cost arm with functionalities similar to that of a real one.<br>
          The team consists of 3 sub-teams: the mechanical engineering team, electrical engineering team, and software engineering team.<br>
          The software engineering team is further split up into 2 subteams: the embedded systems team and the analytics team.<br>
          The mechanical team is responsible for researching and developing the actual physical design of the arm.<br>
          The electrical team designs the circuitry and integrates the electromyogram sensors into the arm's computer system.<br>
          The embedded systems team write the software controlling the entire arm; in a sense, the team is writing a "pseudo-kernel" wrapping the main OS running on the arm.<br>
          Lastly, the analytics team is writing the machine learning scripts running on the arm; these scripts are designed to take in the muscle contractions from the EMG sensors and classify them into distinct finger grips for the robotic finger digits to perform.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team has worked very hard, and as a result of our dedication, we were selected to represent Canada at the 2020 Cybathlon held in Zurich, Switzerland!<br>
          We were especially humbled to be selected for this prestigious competition given that our team was the only team comprised of undergraduate students!<br>
          All other teams were either post-graduate teams or companies with dedicated professionals working for them.<br>
          Unfortunately, this international competition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
          Regardless, our team has continued to perfect out initial design, and have come with v2.0 of our initial product.<br>
          You can view our product and the teams dedicated to its design on our main homepage, linked above.

          Samsung obviously doesn't need any introduction, but the team I was working with specifically worked closely with B2B services that Samsung provides to enterprise partners.<br>
          Samsung mobile phones have extra encryption circuitry embedded in their main chipsets; this feature is called "Samsung Knox".<br>
          In order to interact with this hardware, Samsung provides a software kit called the Samsung Knox SDK, and enterprises/companies can partner with Samsung to purchase licenses for this SDK.<br>

      <div id='raestro_all_about' class='content'>
        <p>
          The Raestro project was born out of necessity, as most software tools/libraries are.<br>
          In Jan 2021, the UBC Bionics Embedded Systems Team migrated over from C++ to Rust, on account of Rust's major safety guarantees.<br>
          As migration ramped up and development of the robotic prosthetic arm continued, our team needed a library to communicate with an external servo controller board called the 6-channel Micro-Maestro.<br>
          Unfortunately, given the relative 'newness' of Rust, its dependency ecosystem was still evolving and there existed no Rust library to communicate with a Maestro.<br>
          So our team decided to bite the bullet and write our own library.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Micro-Maestro uses UART serial pins to communicate with an external microcomputer.<br>
          So using the UART GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (which was the main computer system onboard our robotic prosthesis), we connected that to the Maestro.<br>
          This is where Raestro comes in; Raestro provides a dead-simple API to send protocols implementing the standardized Pololu protocol over UART serial.<br>
          Essentially, all of that lower-level serial communications is neatly abstracted away into nice little API calls.<br>
          This project was so helpful for us, we decided to release it as UBC Bionics' very first Open-Source-Software Project, licensed under the MIT OSS License!<br>
          Up till today, Raestro is on version 0.3.0 and has over 80 downloads!
        </p>
        <p>
          While being a wonderfully helpful OSS project and something that I'm proud of, Raestro also managed to teach me another thing:<br>
          API Design.<br>
          Yes, developing a library and constructing APIs for end-users to interact with is an art; it's not something easily tackle-able.<br>
          Our team struggled for weeks on end just trying to solidify a design; we would always try to implement a design, but would end up asking ourselves "But wait, this design doesn't make sense", or "Oh shoot, we forgot about this crucial use-case".<br>
          In the end though, it was a wonderful project to participate in developing, and it will always be marked as my first truly Open-Source-Software Project.<br>
          Please check out the above links for more information on Raestro, and leave a star on the Github page!
        </p>
        <p>
          As a final note, with regards to the name "Raestro", it is derived as a portmanteau of "Rust" and "Maestro".

      <div id='async_framework_all_about' class='content'>
        <p>
          This is another OSS project that is currently in the works, but with this one being quite a bit more complex than the previous.<br>
          The Embedded Systems Team at UBC Bionics was tasked with making the software running on board the Raspberry Pi with certain requirements for what it must do.<br>
          It needed to contain a generalized "main loop", inside of which we could run some "checks" on the status of the arm, and update an internal "state-machine" accordingly.<br>
          Now, the difference between writing a library and a framework is night and day - a library just contains some abstracted functions, whereas a framework is a generalized application into which you inject your specific functionalities.<br>
          The difference is subtle but quite significant.
        </p>
        <p>
          AsyncFramework is a multi-threaded, asynchronous (i.e., non-blocking) software framework.<br>
          It contains the notion of "components" - essentially just structs that contain an asynchronous execution loop, an address to send messages to, and a "routine".<br>
          A routine is essentially just an array of "jobs" (almost syntactic sugar for closures/lambdas, in our case) to run in an infinite loop.<br>
          The way to work with AsyncFramework is to whip up a bunch of components, put the appropriate jobs in each of them, and pass each other's addresses around so that they can send messages to one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is the point of AsyncFramework?<br>
          Well, the biggest advantage here are its async, multi-threaded components.<br>
          Components are designed to be isolated!<br>
          The effects of any critical failures in one will be mitigated across other threads, but more importantly, after catching any fatal crashes, the component can reboot.<br>
          Components, while being isolated, can also communicate with one another using a custom data-type that the end-user designs!<br>
          That means you can decide how messages will look and how to pass them around!<br>
          And since each component contains an async loop, all message-handlers, jobs, etc., are run asynchronously.
        </p>
        <p>
          The UBC Bionics Embedded Systems Team is hard at work releasing v0.1.0 of AsyncFramework, and we believe it has potential in many use-cases, not just bionic prostheses!<br>
          Once again, for more information, please check out the above link, and leave a star!
        </p>
        <p>
          Another final note:<br>
          AsyncFramework is a terrible name, and will be soon updated to something more fun and catchy.

    <h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
    <p>
      I love rust-lang.<br>
      I have never loved a language more than this one.<br>
      Its wonderful type-inference system (including the fact that it's statically-typed) instantly hooked me.<br>
      I then found out about enums, pattern matching, advanced scoping mechanisms, and a wonder memory-management system that eliminates memory-leaks, and I fell in love even more.<br>
      And then I found out about cargo, and even though rust-crates are starting to suffer from npm-itis (i.e., overbloating dependencies), it still accelerates development tenfold.<br>
      All in all, rust-lang just provides the convenience of higher-level languages with close benefits of lower-level languages (as well as additional safety guarantees).<br>
      I want to spread the gospel of rust, and even though the language still has a long ways to grow, I truly wish for it to become the backbone of all major software in the future.<br>
      Thanks for listening to my rant.
